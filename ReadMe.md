# Future Improvements
1. This project does not take advantage of Spot instances. I would recommend adding Spot Instances and taking advantage of the savings they provide. Don't forget to check your Service Quotas before using Spot instances for the 'G' Instance class.
2. There is always something to improve for someone's use case. I do need some time to walk my dogs, pet my cats, and window shop RTX 4090s.
